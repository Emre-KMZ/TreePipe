# TreePipe
Exploring TreePipe: A Conceptual Shell Command Implementation Challenge in C. This project delves into the intricacies of Unix system programming by simulating 'TreePipe', a conceptual shell command. TreePipe is an inventive exercise that constructs a full binary tree of processes, leveraging Unix pipes for inter-process communication. Each process executes programs that either sum or multiply inputs, based on their tree position, showcasing the mechanics of process communication and management. Although TreePipe serves no practical purpose, it represents a sophisticated challenge in process handling and IPC techniques."
